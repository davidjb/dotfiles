Useful information
==================

Bash
----

* ``cd -`` returns to previous directory
* ``\command`` - appending a backslash avoids aliasing

* Put private bash files into ``.bash_private``. Anything inside this folder
  will be ``source``'d automatically.


Vim
---

* ``box`` and ``bbox`` snippets for a comment box
* ``:SyntasticInfo`` - check syntax reporting
* ``:PymodeLintAuto`` - fix PEP8 issues in Python
